# AnyFilter Visual Studio Extension
This Visual Studio Extension provides filtering commands which passes selected text to an arbitrary external command and replace the text by the output of the command.

## Feature Details
* Settings by "Any Filter Settings..." in Tools menu.
* Registered filter commands will show following the settings command.
* Some samples are available on registration: Mono C# Script, Cygwin bash
    + Attention: the Cygwin bash filter is useful (at least for me), but it might be dangerous because of its powerful and simple name commands.
