# AnyFilter Visual Studio Extension
This Visual Studio Extension provides external filter commands for selected texts,
which passes a selected text to an arbitrary external program and replace the text by the output of the external program.

## Feature Details
* Settings by "AnyFilter Settings..." in Tools menu.
* Registered filter commands will show following the Settings command.
* Some samples are available on filter registration: Mono C# Script, Cygwin bash, sed
    + Attention: the Cygwin bash filter is useful (at least for me), but it might be dangerous because of its powerful and simple name commands.
